#### *Download the theme*

Download the two files (douki.tmTheme, douki.sublime-color-scheme), save them to Sublime Text\Packages\User folder, open sublime, navigate from the sidebar to Preferences -> Select Color Scheme... -> douki

#### *Personal Note* 

A lot of themes I've used have this issue where they color the first letter per folder in a file path/location. I'll find a way to fix that, and re-upload. Also, the fact that funcions are barely a visibly different color from the foreground color, bothers me, and I will update that soon as well. Cheers!
