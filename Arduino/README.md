#### *INSTALLATION*
   Close your Arduino IDE while changing themes, as the changes may be overwritten. Go to your Arduino Folder, open the "lib" folder and inside the "theme" folder (default windows location: *C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\lib\theme*), there should be a "theme" txt file. Rename that as "theme_backup". Then, download the theme.txt file uploaded here and save it in that location (Arduino\lib\theme) without renaming it. Launch your Arduino IDE app, and it should work!
   
#### *PERSONAL NOTE*
   Wanted a Dark version for Arduino that used a color palette closer to my tastes, still needs to be edited.
   Used [This website for the color codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/) and [This Arduino custom theme as a basis for my own twist](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/konradhtc/one-dark-arduino-modern-dark-theme-for-arduino-ide-2fca81).
